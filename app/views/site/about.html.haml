  %p 
    Kenderson Consulting originated from a consulting contract with 
    %a{"href"=>"http://www.iterativedesigns.com"} Iterative Designs
    to assist with various front-end projects, as the company progressed we started working with Ruby on Rails and building web-based applications. Through all the projects, we realized that our true enjoyment is within the act of converting great graphic designs into web content (HTML, &amp; CSS). 
  %p 
    We believe that the the real 
    %i art
    comes into play when you can add touches of JavaScript to bring the page alive. The conversion from graphic design to web content isn't necessarily a highly technical process. What makes one person or company better than another is in their attention to detail. As discussed on our
    %a{"href"=>"/process#cross_browser_design"} Process Page, 
    there are many different browsers that run on various operating systems. So the true challenge is to be able to design the content so that it renders consistently across all of these browsers. Furthermore, a good designer will construct a website so that it
    %i gracefully degrades
    in browsers that fail to load the CSS and JavaScript files or for certain browsers (mostly mobile ones) that limit the use of these files.
  %p As well as getting the technology aspect of the industry correct, we also pride ourselves on being customer focused. The founder of Kenderson Consulting (Ken Henderson) came from a background of Project Management, and truly believes in applying the fundamental aspects of good project management to all of our projects. We believe that good communication is the key to managing the expectations of our customers. We eagerly invest additional effort in the initial stage of each project to better understand the needs of our customers. By achieving this higher level of communication, we are able to deliver better products to our customers.
