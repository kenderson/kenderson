    Until recently (within the past year or so) the process of converting good graphic design into a dynamic website was well understood. The limitations as to what elements would render consistently across the various internet browsers was well documented. For example, if you wanted rounded corners or color gradients on certain elements (these are just 2 examples, there are many more) of your website, you needed to construct those elements with individual images. But we are now in the age of 
    %a{"href"=>"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-roadmap/"} CSS3
    which allows us to create many of these effects without the use of additional images. You might be thinkings.....
    %i why should I be worried about additional images? ... 
    the answer is quite simply that the more images you have on a page the longer the page takes to render. And as your page rendering time increases, you run the risk of frustrating your clients and 
    %a{"href"=>"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html"} losing your ranking in 
    %a{"href"=>"http://www.google.com"} Google 
    searches.
  %p 
    So we believe CSS3 truly helps take web design to the next level, offering a huge variety of features that simplify the way we design for the web; ultimately reducing the cost for our clients. Here's a quick example to show you what I am referring to. 
    %a{"href"=>"http://www.alistapart.com/d/taking-advantage-of-html5-and-css3-with-modernizr/sample-raw.html"} Example Page 1 
    takes you to a page with no style. 
    %a{"href"=>"http://www.alistapart.com/d/taking-advantage-of-html5-and-css3-with-modernizr/sample-basic.html"} Example Page 2 
    adds some minimal CSS style to the page (what we in the web design industry might consider web 1.0 style). But 
    %a{"href"=>"http://www.alistapart.com/d/taking-advantage-of-html5-and-css3-with-modernizr/sample-medium.html"} Example Page 3
    shows a page that is very aesthetically pleasing, with drop-shadows, rounded corners, and styled images (more along the lines of what we would consider web 2.0). The difference with CSS3 is that we no longer need to use images to create rounded corners and gradients, which makes development and subsequent changes much faster/cheaper!

    So you're probably thinking; what's the problem? Well, not all browsers render code the same and are compatible with the full suite of features that these new standards offer. The most problematic browser is Internet Explorer (IE). IE is not compatible with the majority of features being flaunted by CSS3 and HTML5. Check out 
    %a{"href"=>"http://www.findmebyip.com/litmus#target-selector"} this article 
    on the full list of features that the various browsers are compatible with for both HTML5 and CSS3. So the question becomes, how do you design for 
    %i Cross-Browser Compatibility
    consistency with all of the major internet browsers? Keep reading.....
  #cross_browser_design
    %h2 Cross-Browser Design
    %p 
      Good 
      %i Cross-Browser Design 
      means designing a website or application so that it looks the same in all internet browsers. People today use many different browsers. Windows users could be using Internet Explorer 6 (IE6), IE7, IE8, IE9 (coming very soon), Mozilla's FireFox, Safari, Netscape, Google's Chrome, etc. Mac users could be using Safari, Mozilla's FireFox, Chrome, Opera, webkit, etc. The problem is that each of these browsers have a slightly different way of rendering the code on the page, and some of these differences can make your page appear 
      %i broken.
      There are a ton of articles that explain these differences in detail (
      %a{"href"=>"http://css-tricks.com/ie-css-bugs-thatll-get-you-every-time/"} here's a good example
      ), so I'm not going to go into detail about this. Rather, I am going to explain how we design with these limitations in mind.
    %p
      So the challenge (which we pride ourselves on excelling at) is to know the limitations of each of the browsers and develop the website/application so that appears the same no matter what internet browser your clients are viewing it from. At this point you might be thinking to yourself...yeah, I see there are a lot of browsers available, but don't most people just use the latest and greatest one? Well, the short answer is not really. Much to our chagrin, most of the world still uses the dinosaur of browsers; internet explorer. Below is a quick view of the breakdown browser statistics as of June 2010 (
      %a{"href"=>"http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php"} Source
      ).
    %center
      %img{"src"=>"/images/browser_stat.png"}
    %p So when hiring a.
    %table.process_image_comp{:cellspacing=>"0", :cellpadding=>"0", :border=>"0"}
      %tr
        %td
          %img{"src"=>"/images/xbv_1_ie7.png"}
          %p ABOVE: View from IE7
        %td
          %img{"src"=>"/images/xbv_1_saf.png"}
          %p ABOVE: View from Safari
    %p Below is another very basic example of a website in IE7 and then in Safari. Notice how the content seems jumbled? That's because IE7 (and IE6) add a few extra pixels of padding to the right container, which pushes it below the left container.    
    %table.process_image_comp{:cellspacing=>"0", :cellpadding=>"0", :border=>"0"}
      %tr
        %td
          %img{"src"=>"/images/xbv_2_ie7.png"}
          %p ABOVE: View from IE7
        %td
          %img{"src"=>"/images/xbv_2_saf.png"}
          %p ABOVE: View from Safari
    %p So the take away from this article is that you should be aware these differences when hiring a website designer/developer, and make sure that they are going to keep these things in-mind when designing your website!. 

  %p 
    So in summary, HTML5 and CSS3 offer some very cool functionality, but the problem is that this functionality isn't supported by all browsers yet. Microsoft is saying that IE9 will support some of these new features, but IE9 is not yet available. So if your a web designer who has a customer with IE clientele (which given the stats above - most people do), and you want your website to appear identically in all browsers, you need to stick with the tried and true ways of bringing a little extra style to the page.
  
  #graceful_degrdation
    %h2 Graceful Degradation
    %p 
      Once again we'll start with a definition. Graceful Degradation refers to how your website looks when it is viewed through a browser that does not have stylesheet rendering capabilities (mostly mobile browsers), or when some happens on the user side of the site that prevents the stylesheet from loading. A very common practice for the web design industry is to use stylized images to present text that is critical to the users understanding of the site. But what happens when the stylesheet doesn't load? The image doesn't load, which means that the user doesn't see the text. The best way of integrating text into graphics like this is to include a 
      %i span
      tag to place text inside is the graphical element, and use the stylesheet to hide the text. So when the stylesheet doesn't load, the image doesn't load, but the text does. Below is a quick example of a site without and without good graceful degradation.
    %table.process_image_comp{:cellspacing=>"0", :cellpadding=>"0", :border=>"0"}
      %tr
        %td{:colspan=>"2"}
          %img{"src"=>"/images/xbv_1_ie7.png"}
          %p ABOVE: Original Site ( Notice XXX Section)
      %tr
        %td
          %img{"src"=>"/images/xbv_1_ie7.png"}
          %p ABOVE: Site without the stylesheet loaded (bad graceful degradation - no text showed up when the image didn't load)
        %td
          %img{"src"=>"/images/xbv_1_saf.png"}
          %p ABOVE: Site without the stylesheet loaded (Good graceful degradation - text showed up when the image didn't load)
