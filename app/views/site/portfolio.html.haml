        As part of consulting through

        , I handled the graphic design conversion for the
        %i refreshed
        Craig Coyne website. We worked with Frank Strategic Marketing (FSM) for the design of the site. This design was built on a very early version of rails. It used rails to construct an email system, where the users could submit their emails from the front end of the application, and the administrator could log-into the back-end, collect those email, and send a common mailer. The site also uses rails for the blog and "favorite links" sections. It also highlights the use JavaScript in a number of different ways; the image slideshow on the front page, the "flyout" menu bars, the "slideshow" type style on the "Our Wares" page. I also assisted with the shopping cart integration into the rails app. We used Shopify to provide the client with an affordable, low cost, easy to use, and well integrated solution.

      %p 
        This particular application spawned from IT support contract that we had with a small Legal Firm. The firm was using an outdated software package that had to be hosted locally, and was full of issues. As a collaboration with 
        %a{:href=>"http://iterativedesigns.com"} Iterative Designs
        , we suggested the development of a new web-based and externally hosted solution. After developing, and testing the application with this law firm, we decided to open it up for other accounts.

        Protegus website. By request of the client, the back-end of this site was constructed using Expression Engine (a PHP driven Content management system). This site highlights the use of JavaScript to create the slideshow/top menu on the front page of the site. We also incorporated a few touches of JavaScript into the hover effects of the menu and the front page tabbed section.

        This was a great project! we worked with Alex Hsiao and Nicole Zhang (co-founders of

        ) to help consult on the front-end development of the ModWedding
        %a{:href=>"http://modwedding.com/themes.html"} themes
        , development of 
        %a{:href=>"http://modwedding.com/features.html"} ModCards
        , and the recent architecture of an automated theme builder. The automated theme builder provided the ability for an administrator to create custom layouts for new "themes" by simply uploading new images and selecting from a matrix of available layout options. This functionality helped Alex and Nicole reduce the costs associated with hiring someone to specifically develop and test new themes and in-turn reduce the time it takes to release new themes.

        was using a Content Management System (CMS) that provided the capability for them to update their client-side content (blog articles, files, images, and text), but it would only render appropriately in Internet Explorer (IE).
        %a{:href=>"http://d3systems.com"} D3 Systems
        contacted us and was looking for a cost efficient replacement for their current solution. We set-up new hosting for them, created a new 
        %a{:href=>"http://wordpress.com"} WordPress
        application for them, and transitioned all of their current content into the new application. We also provided internal training to their corporate users and stakeholders.
      %p
        In the transition to the new host, we updated and optimized the HTML and CSS (no graphic design updates), and in doing so we were able to reduce the page loading speed from 3.00 seconds to 0.75 seconds.

The ACSOR Surveys website was running on a Content Management System (CMS) that provided the capability for them to update their client-side content (blog articles, files, images, and text), but it would only render appropriately in Internet Explorer (IE).
        Similarly to what we did with the

        website, we were contracted to provide a cost efficient replacement for their current solution. We set-up new hosting, created a new
